# #Hi

&nbsp;

I am **Bhone Htet Aung**, a computer engineering student studying in Polytechnic in Singapore. This is a *blog* I do for fun, where I uploaded things I learn and I am interested in, along with my projects. I intend this blog to be an archive for future uses.

You can find categories under the following section. Each category is organised in individual web page, containing blog posts related to it.
